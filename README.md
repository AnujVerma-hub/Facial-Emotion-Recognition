# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
It is a repo in which i've created FER model using various machine learning concepts using tensorflow and python libraries
In this i've used Transfer learnnig using a pretrained VGG model.
Also an another model which is created with the help of convolutional neural network.
Those models classify facial expressions into one of the seven categories below.
Angry--Disgust--Fear--Happy--Sad--Surprise--Neutral

## dataset:

The dataset i've used is the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle dataset collections which can be found at this link:- https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013
Dataset contains almost 35000 images which is classified below:
- Training images ~28k
- Validation images ~3580
- Test images ~3580


## model architecture:

Their are two models that i've used which achieved the accuracies:
- CNN MODEL - 58%
- VGG MODEL -
